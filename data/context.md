## Emerald Tablets

Emerald Tablets are small green items found typically near Orbs of True Knowledge, containing game lore. When examined, tablets show their text in glowing green glyphs that slowly morph into readable text. Some tablets can be reforged into Stone Tablets at the Anvil in Hiisi Base (bottom right).

**Note:** Exact coordinates are not available in the source data. Locations are described by biome/area.

| Name | Location | Text | Reforgeable | Stone Tablet Text |
|------|----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Emerald Tablet of Thoth | On top of the Pyramid in the Desert | "The necessity of concealing the Art is one of the chief anxieties of alchemists. We are sworn to secrecy by heaven and earth and hell, By the four elements, by the height and the depth, By Hermes, by Anubis, and by the howlings of Kerkoros. An oath has been required of us to reveal nothing clearly to any uninitiated being." | Cannot | - |
| Secretorum Hermetis | Located in the Forest to the left in the giant tree above the Collapsed Mines | "The sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge Is the highest tribute to the gods." | Cannot | - |
| Tabula Smaragdina | The right side of the Mines near the Lava Lake | "If all the mountains were of silver and gold, What would they profit a man who lives in constant fear of death? Hence there cannot be in the whole world anything better than our Medicine, Which has power to heal all the diseases of the flesh." | Cannot | - |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume I | Located high in the air directly above the starting Mountain inside the floating island, beneath the altar | "Tis true without lying, certain and most true. That which is below is like that which is above And that which is above is like that which is below To do the miracles of one only thing And as all things have been and arose From one by the mediation of one: So all things have their birth From this one thing by adaptation." | Cannot | - |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume II | At the bottom of the Frozen Vault | "Thence is born a spirit white as snow, And another spirit red as blood, Which two spirits are contained In a third hidden thing." | Yes | "The essence of life and death." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume III | Located beneath the Lava Lake east of the Mines | "Heed my warning, or death and decay will follow." | Cannot | - |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume IV | At the bottom of the Sandcave | "The definition of death is the disjunction of the composite, But there is no disjunction of that which is simple, for it is one. Death consists in the separation of the soul from the body, Because anything formed out of two, three, or four components Must disintegrate, and this is death. Understand, further, That no complex substance which lacks fire eats, drinks, or sleeps, Because in all things which have a spirit fire is that which eats." | Yes | "Prove thine knowledge, from what is the west created of." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume V | The left side of the Magical Temple | "And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, And the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou Two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once at the number three, Being the third number be reached, then, Lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch Towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, Shall snuff it.'" | Yes | "Prove thine knowledge, from what the east is created of." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume VI | Towards the bottom of the Lukki Lair | "Some Alchemists fancy that the work from beginning to end is a mere idle entertainment; But those who make it so will reap what they have sown -- nothing. We know that next to the Divine Blessing, and the discovery of the proper foundation, Nothing is so important as unwearied industry and perseverance in this First Operation. It is no wonder, then, that so many students of this Art are reduced to beggary; They are afraid of work, and look upon our Art as mere sport for their leisure moments. For no labour is more tedious than that which the preparatory part of our enterprise demands." | Yes | "To have true knowledge is to see the darkness of ignorance." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume VII | Past the lava pool that Tabula Smaragdina can be found near, over a chasm, in The Orb Room | "Among those who devote themselves to the transmutation of metals, However, there can be no such thing as mediocrity of attainment. A person who studies this Art, must have either everything or nothing. An Alchemist who knows only half their craft, reaps nothing but disappointment And waste of time and money; moreover, they lay themselves open to the mockery of those who despise our Art. Those, indeed, who succeed in reaching the goal of the Magistery, have not only infinite riches, but the means of continued life and health. Hence it is the most popular of all pursuits." | Yes | "To gain true knowledge, one must slow down and not hurry." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume VIII | In the middle of The Work (Hell) | "Woe unto all ye fools! How ignorant are ye of this Art, for which ye would die if ye knew it! I swear to you that if kings were familiar with it, none of us would ever attain this thing. O how this nature changeth body into spirit! O how admirable is Nature, how she presides over all, and overcomes all." | Yes | "Awaken, the flock of the shepherd and think for thyself!" |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume IX | In The Orb Room, located deep within the Snow Chasm | "In this way, then, Nature generates by means of this sulphur the different kinds of metals in the veins of the earth, according to the diversity of degrees and alterations." | Yes | "To walk a mile in someone else's boots." |
| Emerald Tablet - Volume X | At the bottom of the Desert Chasm in a temple similar to The Orb Room | "Take, he tells us, the stone of gold, combine with humour Which is permanent water, set in its vessel, Over a gentle fire until liquefaction takes place. Then leave it until the water dries, And the sand and water are combined, one with another; Then let the fire be more intense than before, Until it again becomes dry, and is made earth. When this is done, Understand that here is the beginning of the arcanum; But do this many times, until two-thirds of the water perish, And colours manifest unto you." | Yes | "True knowledge is a slippery thing. The unfortunate side effects of our divine stone." |
